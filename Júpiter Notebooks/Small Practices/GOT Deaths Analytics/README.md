# Analisis of deaths in GOT using Pandas
\
 This is just a practice of Pandas using Jupiter to answer some questions about the deaths in GOT.\
\
The questions we are going to answer here will be:\
\
1 - ¿How many characters die in GOT?\
2 - ¿How many characters die after season 3 in GOT?\
3 - ¿How many deaths were by Wildfire?\
4 - ¿How many weapons were used to kill in GOT?\
5 - ¿Which were the 5 weapons most used to kill in GOT?\
6 - ¿How many episodes with at least one death has GOT?\
7 - If GOT where a game and kill with and arrow give you 3 points, ¿How many points would you has got during seasons 2, 5 and 6?\
8 - ¿How many characters would have been killed by House Lannister and House Targaryen if this 2 were just one House called The kill house?\
\
At the end we are going to create a table with the numbers of deaths by episode and season.
